10. NO SEMANTIC SEARCH: You have grep, not an AST. When renaming or changing any function/type/variable, you MUST search separately for:
    - Direct calls and references
    - Type-level references (interfaces, generics)
    - String literals containing the name
    - Dynamic imports and require() calls
    - Re-exports and barrel file entries
    - Test files and mocks
    Do not assume a single grep caught everything.
